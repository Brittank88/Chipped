- Reworked the workbench gui. It now features a stylized screen with
a searchbar, slots, and a preview window with 4 modes: single, horizontal,
vertical, and 2x2. 
- Multiple blocks can be crafted at the same time by pressing the craft button
in the new GUI while holding shift.
- Fixed typo with coarse sand.
- Fixed the alchemy bench having the wrong title in the GUI.
- Added highlight support to the workbenches. This makes their hitboxes perfect.
- Workbenches now keep their item in the workbench.
- Fixed workbenches not breaking faster with an axe.
- Fixed REI not registering on Forge.
